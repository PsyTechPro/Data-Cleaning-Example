# Data Cleaning Example

This repository contains an example of data cleaning and transformation techniques applied to a fictional dataset that I created. The dataset is entirely fictitious and was designed for instructional purposes to demonstrate common data cleaning workflows using Python.

## Features
In this project, I showcase the following data cleaning steps:
1. **Dropping irrelevant columns**: Focusing only on relevant data for analysis.
2. **Standardizing categorical data**: Cleaning inconsistent entries in columns like "Gender."
3. **Filtering rows**: Including only specific departments such as Marketing, Finance, Sales, and Operations.
4. **Handling missing values**: Imputing or removing missing entries in numeric fields.
5. **Splitting date fields**: Separating "Date Hired" into "Year Hired" and "Month Hired" for easier analysis.
6. **Cleaning numeric columns**: Extracting numerical values from text fields like "Annual Salary."
7. **Analyzing text data**: Counting occurrences of specific skills in job descriptions for the "Operations" department.

## Technologies Used
