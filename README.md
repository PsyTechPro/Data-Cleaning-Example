# Data Cleaning Example

This repository contains an example of data cleaning and transformation techniques applied to a fictional dataset that I created. The dataset is entirely fictitious and was designed for instructional purposes to demonstrate common data cleaning workflows using Python.

## Features
In this project, I showcase the following data cleaning steps:
1. **Dropping irrelevant columns**: Focusing only on relevant data for analysis.
2. **Standardizing inconsistent data**: Cleaning inconsistent entries in columns like "Gender."
3. **Filtering rows**: Including only specific job roles for analysis.
4. **Drop invalid cases**: Removing rows with invalid entries 
5. **Handling missing values**: Imputing or removing missing entries in numeric fields.
6. **Splitting date fields**: Separating data in the "Date Hired" column into separate "Year Hired" and "Month Hired" for easier analysis.
7. **Cleaning numeric columns**: Extracting numerical values from text fields like "Annual Salary."
8. **Analyzing text data (language translation)**: Counting occurrences of specific skills in job descriptions for the "Operations" department.
